As a result, we often overlook the beauty of nature at night, simply because we cannot, or perhaps, refuse to see it.\n\nYet nature still thrives at night, as shown by the blooming of the tropical moonflower (Ipomoea alba), whose petals open at dusk and fade at sunrise. This flowering vine produces multiple white sweet-smelling blooms every night, luring and supporting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. As the alter ego to the familiar diurnal morning glory, the moonflower becomes a testament to nature's unceasing beauty even in the darkest of nights.\n\nAkin to the pinhole camera, _Flora Obscura_ is a dark chamber of smoked glass and black ceramic, housing the nocturnal moonflower in the environment it flourishes in. Using the slight imbalance between the warmer inner temperature (due to the moonflower's respiration) and the cooler external air, a convection current is established, allowing air to be circulated in and out of the planter through the bottom air vents and the top opening. Picking up the moonflower's natural scent molecule Linalool (C10H18O) along the way, scientifically known for its soothing properties, this scented air is amplified and distributed throughout the room. As a bubble of the night in the house, Flora Obscura becomes a window to the less-explored domain of nature in the dark, and its scent a calming relief to the stressful fast-paced life in the city.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recEBgPuH7QUVlRGf","index":187},{"id":"rec2ODMhOsbvko4WR","index":228}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40bc858932c452212a72262a662e728/5e1e308b?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e8ef7e96d9dd56ad","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a09388512b4cca6e5139749112895721/e47e8268?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e7bc474cf213afc9","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/330aae1dddc840feefc35021224fedd6/e1ac82da?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f91c886c8a3311c1"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5f5dd155850ee2c72bdc55c44c79cd76/98bfa3b6/FloraObscura_0?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=34d42810fe8387c4","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/57e760a1dfe8d0441d3f3831f3744584/97e9025b/FloraObscura_1?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=c9ddf1fa9aec14f8","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c9c8bf20231a0b7fed353d9525471727/6232edb1/FloraObscura_2?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=09c74322e3d10af4"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40bc858932c452212a72262a662e728/5e1e308b?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e8ef7e96d9dd56ad","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"abO3FvOn6o4","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recAnxXl58sggAcjh_0.jpeg","recAnxXl58sggAcjh_1.jpeg","recAnxXl58sggAcjh_2.jpeg"]},{"id":"rechBVDpZ4ZAgN1zN","gradsite":true,"name":"Remember Me","description":"_Remember Me_ is a book that fades with time.

Its goal is to allow the experiences of a free wandering mind to be brought onto the realm of transit.\n","platform":{"id":"recWWkMHhM1Sxdal4","index":12},"designers":[{"id":"recCblRtplANiQdcV","index":26},{"id":"recs0pMB9mgyZzuym","index":224}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bba2808a3604c44ce9b8c2537a691a5d/27babc2d?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a1fcc493131e166d","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/14db1d63f38c35d8635052e15ac3dc1f/762ba0f2?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=9849b43745487bbb","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c0a81efc59013878ad1781695d75ef8a/b9b676b1?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=70dff0f05a392683"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/80fe19a0be0c30ba8cc053f5e65fa15a/b768c6b2/InspireS1-FutureofMobileWorking_2?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=0ac9f215ded618cf","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e4f65763243b41ecef47f937ef14f9b7/efaf15a2/InspireS1-FutureofMobileWorking_0?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=4938538fc4651a0b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/a14da5fd4aeed6f641be0dfb84a596c8/0118c513/InspireS1-FutureofMobileWorking_1?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=ab5a74af4620a3c1"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bba2808a3604c44ce9b8c2537a691a5d/27babc2d?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a1fcc493131e166d","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"643355320","type":"vimeo"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry"],"imageNames":["rec2xRFkheZBgGa7D_0.png","rec2xRFkheZBgGa7D_1.png","rec2xRFkheZBgGa7D_2.png"]},{"id":"recqtvVrMi7qLdCN5","gradsite":true,"name":"Ascension","description":"_Ascension_ is an 18 hour journey to space where its transit is more than just about the journey or destination.

Excess water is vaporized and released back into the atmosphere.\n \nThe common area of the first floor, is furnished with wooden accents and soft ambient lighting familiar to the ambience of a home. One would feel safe to unwind and roam free. Passengers can dine and relax while enjoying the panoramic view of the horizon.

It allows one to design realistic interactions through combining relatively simple and low-cost materials, such as PTFE and copper tape. Since contact between these conductive and insulated surfaces produce static electricity, it may be harnessed to translate common physical interactions into digital feedback in interactive books. Examples of how this may be achieved are demonstrated in The Clean Bear, a book that teaches kids about good hygiene and self-care habits through pretend-play. Light and sound feedback are used as sensory cues to encourage proper habits such as brushing teeth, flossing and brushing hair, thereby improving their motor skills as well.\n","platform":{"id":"recOtcAlvZiyD3azc","index":18},"designers":[{"id":"recec9ich8mg4CzrK","index":194}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9339fe550f4e7fc15bc31ba9dc5fc6d7/73097a98?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b74a4349bb328926","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9bc48eb9a4a419eb82f51012298bfd36/9e146e27?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=028ec9e390571586","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a7a11a934b84404ef08c119781665303/70014329?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=64ac5a109321f563"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ce17c53869353b5878a139cf9717f5fc/147d3052/TheCleanBear_0?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=c695f5b0a01a29b2","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/19353c3b42182ad6789a397739ea55a7/515c2356/TheCleanBear_1?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=76d841a53a614700","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/497e717258dddd091152fe0410d7b582/d44006e7/TheCleanBear_2?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=71e875b005b6c13f"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9339fe550f4e7fc15bc31ba9dc5fc6d7/73097a98?ts=1653965832&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b74a4349bb328926","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"640233973","type":"vimeo"},"specialization":["Product Innovation"],"imageNames":["recIl9qGPpMwudDP0_0.jpeg","recIl9qGPpMwudDP0_1.jpeg","recIl9qGPpMwudDP0_2.png"]},{"id":"rec3ZvfmiUrWANSNd","name":"Orbitals","description":"Orbitals is an interactive art project in which user input creates moving white particles and grey lines on the screen (the canvas).

This resonates with the very idea of lattice structures, where every subtle detail in the lattice’s geometry contributes to its eventual functionality and value. Instead of targeting multiple product features for a single function, a well-designed lattice - when applied in a product - can bring about multiple benefits within a single feature. The earliest examples include megastructures like the Eiffel Tower (1887), whereas today, additively manufactured meso and micro-scale lattice structures are widely used in the medical industry.

He deploys design as medium, making use of utility as a pretext for visual discourse, while maintaining a keen focus in developing materials and processes. The embedded narratives in his works comment on design and its industry as a phenomenon, especially in the context of heritage, consumption and waste. His works have been shown in exhibitions such as “Singletown” at the Venice Biennale, “Surface art/design” in Dortmund and Cologne, “Beauty” at the Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial, Smithsonian Design Museum New York, and “Local Icons East/West” at MAXXI Museo, Rome. He is a two-time winner of Design of the Year at the President's Design Award, Singapore's highest design accolade. His works are held in private collections, as well as public permanent collections at the National Collection of Singapore; M+ Museum for Visual Culture, Hong Kong; and the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, New York. Hans has also actively engaged in curatorial work and has produced several exhibitions with a keen interest in the discursive capacity of design to engage public perceptions. His penchant for design pedagogy is guided by the concept of deformative inquiry, developing imaginative thinking tools that provide novel approaches to the design process based on generative deformations, use of language and systematic reflection. The student works developed under his supervision has garnered many international awards, and he is a three-time winner of the NUS Annual Excellent Teaching Award.\n","portrait":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/916d883fb19c0ab02f48f74db6c8a80f/bd41a0df/Hans_Tan_v3.jpg?ts=1653965834&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=c7b58b18cbb2e1f0","thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e76fa978a60bb53a6abc5c8daa3c22a9/9e769754?ts=1653965834&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=9f94d3723ed834a9","email":"hans@nus.edu.sg","link":"https://hanstan.net/","platforms":[{"id":"recAV4nYxdYomj4T9","index":2},{"id":"recDDWRO1WcHneotE","index":37},{"id":"recRvYINQzpCzZNhe","index":50},{"id":"rec0OzteP5gigq7tP","index":77},{"id":"recoHhsXsL7i9RcnJ","index":100},{"id":"recm8lrYmJGKUvLTn","index":116},{"id":"rec8A4HoMecvFfu0v","index":117}],"thesis":[{"id":"recVV6GSnWTGWHlbQ","index":39},{"id":"recuY14V2hnKVxbT4","index":24},{"id":"reckXCpGUQg0jFDw3","index":29},{"id":"recUrEopAFnsGybuo","index":14},{"id":"rec778SZhj32lBLV8","index":12},{"id":"recalvDKLqSjFXN87","index":13}],"active":"Actively teaching","position":"Full Time","order":2,"imageNames":["recuASntmmDCKQFId_0.jpeg"]},{"id":"recDyMJ3kM1DtHkTF","name":"Lee Jung-Joo","bio":"JJ has expertise in Service Design, Human-Centered Design, Co-Design and User Experience Design.

controller does not normally come to mind. \n\nIf digital experiences are a mountain, conventional controllers are elevators to reach the peak. However you could also drive, hike, or take a cable car up the mountain, which are experiences in themselves. This project investigates how controls affect our relationship with game worlds thus our experiences with them, through the space of alternative control games. Even for a single interaction, like jumping, the way we input that jump in physical reality can drastically change the meanings it can have. This space is an opportunity to design new game experiences around controllers.\n\n«Press What? to Jump» is the expression of this exploration, a game about swapping between different alternative controllers for the same action. Through this the player samples the experience of designing alternative controls and understanding the nuances that each controller gives the same interaction.\n","keywords":"Experience, Speculative, Exploratory\n","gradsite":true,"designers":[{"id":"recGBguxAAlSCmG9t","index":46}],"supervisors":[{"id":"recT9JlcC0pm8IbtB","index":3}],"images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93ad944d05eb23b7e9bff09de7739ed7/395ee295?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b6215520e8e4f80b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/17aac0bd14f5e19729b239797b777eb6/91f8447d?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=ae3edb73d2194ecc","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0c56d86fa0118c71ea974baa8bd663bd/0696694c?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=959debbcddc2ee5f","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6052de0115214bb801a3bd47dec6a3f8/96bfc369?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=7421dd2eba4f9307"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/35251cd28d5e8926a718dfadfcd7b585/973cdc09/hero.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2569607e7344bd2b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/650b4cd910624c075b5b0b14c65f91ff/2237e4b5/thesis1.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8161f5711b6cc0be","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8eb856aa8bd6dcbb63a3020c8d34a256/873307cd/thesis2.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=ba6bec864779b670","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f0faebfef765b107eeb5f829fabb7dea/5696475e/thesis3.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d5c885d6577f8ddd"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93ad944d05eb23b7e9bff09de7739ed7/395ee295?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b6215520e8e4f80b","captions":["","The 2 player game is a simple race where players only jump.

All made with traditional materials then finished in black, each item is like a letter to be composed on a page of white.\n","keywords":"Product, Experience, Exploratory","gradsite":true,"designers":[{"id":"recguV38T0cmTnLzM","index":14}],"supervisors":[{"id":"recee8zPyZUohrFv5","index":2}],"images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/74e18a8ee0e08c9882266cfae3eb9516/924657f3?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=096f8db158a3bfdb","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9f7448afcb982f6e8a1da89c3a8c4b1c/1f96e636?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8445c9c7c80cfa5c","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e3259d11227f06fe801d15e3c549418f/673a7cf1?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=204b880d60daba5d","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2ad9ffed9db4808a2c1721efacb4eb3d/44ad28d5?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=50603daced26fc5e","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/60a03fb61896032f99abca4aaf3708d9/77738bb1?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=cfd5b8285d417af1","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0f4e97d84036d4ea7a9e55720b53c64d/392f5d38?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=984e239ff500a97c"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/69d50e32ee038aa9a25940d676662361/7b8e1a19/hero-image.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b2a46e5d02690195","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c0d87859ab014406a2528f9691559c1/d77f7f8f/on-table.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=5b75a936c4498fb3","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/43bc9d221da25ed722f814c3c21248e8/fcfd1c5f/silverware-alignment-3.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2fdf57fffb53889c","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/2545eaf2b5e0c1c39a91d014e9d5b10a/c9daf8d4/on-shelf.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=33411a9b54a5eee1","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8049a42ddd621e5885858f5dde01efc0/413aa66f/typography-lines.png?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=15640df692e96822","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0bd1319f258b876fe6f5f1501e69de0e/0dd1b957/product-journey-final-2.gif?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2571e6d4ce8dffef"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/74e18a8ee0e08c9882266cfae3eb9516/924657f3?ts=1653965833&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=096f8db158a3bfdb","captions":["","On the table, Dine Serif complements the art of table setting by adopting typographic details to intuitively guide users.","With the ‘serif’ detail right at the midpoint of all silverware, users are able to neatly align and space them apart with ease.
