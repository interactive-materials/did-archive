The Asian House Gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus,  is one of the few species demonstrating extraordinary commensal behaviour living closely alongside humans. The house gecko hunts by artificial lighting, which acts as a beacon for insects.\n\nIs harmonious living between humans and geckos possible? How might an object allow us to rediscover the familiar house gecko in a sensible and practical manner? We live with the Asian House Gecko everyday, yet we remain unaware of their value. Harena seeks to help shift human perceptions of common house geckos from pests to friends, from fear to curiosity.\n\nWhen the day turns dark, Harena comes to life with ambient light sensing. The night life of geckos takes stage as the illuminating frame hangs high, attracting insects – mostly mosquitoes – that geckos love feeding on. With Harena, geckos pose as still life subjects and take the lead in the play between prey and predator. The feast, the spectacle, and the go-between. We observe Harena as a stage for live gecko-pest interactions. A sculpture in the day, Harena becomes a functional light in the night; emerging as a visual device that lends an aura of importance to the work of geckos within its frame. Like a study on still life, there is a lesson in looking. The visual alliance between Harena and geckos is fascinating and educational, as we rediscover the familiar house gecko protecting us from household pests. \n\nOnce we accept the frame, we accept the house geckos that come along with it. Harena is an act of thought made visible, making for a succinct and powerful commentary. Harena is a feast for the geckos, and towards harmonious living with nature.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recKD6kWAOUFxMgFB","index":14},{"id":"recXPczt4NBwXbqDY","index":174}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0b2f7fc08f83ec55fce953b9acf16142/b55ab61e?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8e9d6d63af211750","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e03e464bd730e8953daefc5972322dba/99357aa6?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d952027a4e8a3f91","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9cd24f78867ca705890706486628c5d5/7f5148fa?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e9b0b528eb96f881"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9cee557e8f861449a878b639fa57d823/8a868f38/Harena_0?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=44646fc0853fc181","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/af8b151e066bba758d06cbc094142bc3/99bb5dcc/Harena_1?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=c617ba5fee78887e","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e54afa325bdfc6765f8ef658b5758d55/8932c6e0/Harena_2?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=5f8e94cafa4cb434"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0b2f7fc08f83ec55fce953b9acf16142/b55ab61e?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8e9d6d63af211750","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"4VDhSBGHd48","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["rec9GTyhNPDcH1lGN_0.jpeg","rec9GTyhNPDcH1lGN_1.png","rec9GTyhNPDcH1lGN_2.png"]},{"id":"recAnxXl58sggAcjh","name":"Flora Obscura","description":"When one thinks about nature, chances are he would imagine a beautiful landscape, painted in lush greenery and dotted with flowers glistening under the sun. Sadly, we have become accustomed to appreciate the environment around us only when it is well-lit. Light pollution, especially in developed cities like Singapore, have altered the way we perceive the dark, and we subconsciously translate the mere loss of visibility to something frightening and macabre. As a result, we often overlook the beauty of nature at night, simply because we cannot, or perhaps, refuse to see it.\n\nYet nature still thrives at night, as shown by the blooming of the tropical moonflower (Ipomoea alba), whose petals open at dusk and fade at sunrise. This flowering vine produces multiple white sweet-smelling blooms every night, luring and supporting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. As the alter ego to the familiar diurnal morning glory, the moonflower becomes a testament to nature's unceasing beauty even in the darkest of nights.\n\nAkin to the pinhole camera, Flora Obscura is a dark chamber of smoked glass and black ceramic, housing the nocturnal moonflower in the environment it flourishes in. Using the slight imbalance between the warmer inner temperature (due to the moonflower's respiration) and the cooler external air, a convection current is established, allowing air to be circulated in and out of the planter through the bottom air vents and the top opening. Picking up the moonflower's natural scent molecule Linalool (C10H18O) along the way, scientifically known for its soothing properties, this scented air is amplified and distributed throughout the room. As a bubble of the night in the house, Flora Obscura becomes a window to the less-explored domain of nature in the dark, and its scent a calming relief to the stressful fast-paced life in the city.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recEBgPuH7QUVlRGf","index":183},{"id":"rec2ODMhOsbvko4WR","index":222}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40bc858932c452212a72262a662e728/5e1e308b?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=0c4bc19e30b8e32f","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a09388512b4cca6e5139749112895721/e47e8268?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e4fdec9d2386238a","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/330aae1dddc840feefc35021224fedd6/e1ac82da?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=bdf18b2c2de70187"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5f5dd155850ee2c72bdc55c44c79cd76/98bfa3b6/FloraObscura_0?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d725568c50f6a298","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/57e760a1dfe8d0441d3f3831f3744584/97e9025b/FloraObscura_1?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=1466d37147f6ddc0","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c9c8bf20231a0b7fed353d9525471727/6232edb1/FloraObscura_2?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=097350a14f409a82"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40bc858932c452212a72262a662e728/5e1e308b?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=0c4bc19e30b8e32f","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"abO3FvOn6o4","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recAnxXl58sggAcjh_0.jpeg","recAnxXl58sggAcjh_1.jpeg","recAnxXl58sggAcjh_2.jpeg"]},{"id":"recneZLCKnK1ECWrr","name":"Tsikato","description":"Tsikato is a sculptural piece, sparking curiosity and conversation of the noise pollution we contribute that affects the Cicadas while amplifying their music and protecting them from our noise pollution.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recoWBYxVS9I173BG","index":202},{"id":"rec3AdtNUDnvvimra","index":226}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c121e7cf07ced4dd444ccb79210a30bb/200415d8?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=764a6957708bb638","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4571fe7a87e24130d9796db176b14814/4c427b40?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=10e1df2345ac2396","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/db2c5fae18c69a24243f2997c778f616/3b647aab?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=45cbb933a809390c","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/28277bfa7e93ec7daf06a05bee7b4389/9e94f814?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=223bb18612571335","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6bfcde27d6bdaa97c6ac61a5245ebbf2/2555f0be?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=572b52addffa44b5","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/51999e746996da66adca87fba44df525/190d3225?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=6914281f67d59f22"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/535001d898a5300eb6d2b32ccd0b05d4/a2c6a104/Tsikato_0?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a480354fa6f07000","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/32e8c28e2f9ded0a0381879b68444981/8018524e/Tsikato_1?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d2c54e6b9587e3cd","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5fddfa4e6ad33e9069d8545da986107c/85c77afa/Tsikato_2?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8a9e02bad9342d41","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0fa842b0b161c28c824a45503c7d6ee7/4b0a1743/Tsikato_3?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f4e08b5fd4462227","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/12eb530ce70d048ad703f720fd62fee9/886a78f8/Tsikato_4?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=434a404fb8bdae5e","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/da961db1a9c66424e49f9044b0c0ebc3/44aa1c2f/Tsikato_5?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a59fa5cc5e11bfb6"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c121e7cf07ced4dd444ccb79210a30bb/200415d8?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=764a6957708bb638","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"wJ4UQ-bxHFI","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_0.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_1.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_2.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_3.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_4.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_5.jpeg"]},{"id":"recmcH1XMhcKEKtus","name":"Kanopi","description":"Kanopi is an expression of the diversity of trees in Singapore.

Corals are now bleaching at an alarming rate worldwide due to our actions. In Singapore, land reclamation has accelerated the bleaching of corals. Irresponsible fishing of corals to make jewellery is one of the less spoken topics. It is ironic that people value corals dead more than alive, decorating themselves with coral skeletons.\n\nWe designed this series of jewelries to pay tribute to the life of corals; experiencing their beauty without human intervention. Imitating how coral grows, the jewelry flows along the curves of the human body. Leading lines create an illusion of growth, hinting to people the possibility of corals flourishing.\n\nWe observed from our beaches that seashells and coral fragments glisten under the sun before being washed ashore, but once we brought them home, they became dull and rough. What better way to showcase the beauty of corals than to show people the color of corals underwater, at their optimal living condition. The idea of duality of life and death: thriving under water, lifeless ashore. Through material exploration, we noticed that the process of sandblasting crystal or glass followed by submerging it in water will cause the translucent sandblast piece to turn crystal clear.\n\nThe jewellery, when placed into water, reveals red color underneath its sandblasted surface while the surface turns clear. However, when worn on the body, it becomes white and rough. Drawing references to human intervention, the ritual of wearing jewellery becomes important, reflecting the decision people can make. To leave the corals alone in the water where it belongs or to intervene, resulting in the death of the species. We believe that nature should be left alone,and that’s when they thrive .To be alive is colourful.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recHdGUCDAVQMadoq","index":227},{"id":"recoi6cI6X2GOZRdH","index":10}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3f4caaa98c0aafea4cb8b1257c6b37e7/752963aa?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=9d8eb54811973a81","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/889477481eeb914a2d617f0f61510f05/238e603b?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=52c91bac6d9e1ba1","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2ae10757f9b96704c32ab6fc82538e88/2ae9008c?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2bad8c437ac54ae4","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/33e4ce1c8fa97aa17ce6a3001d1f1d5f/834dd7e4?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=4c12db5785003ab5","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ece846b9983c42bb5f87abf91e9106c2/b1e86123?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=84dd875a0ba6fa7b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/199b475ae89a28ff42d72b01a78ba43a/6f78a601?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=94e7351559d9ed28","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bcc96441adec22019a6c6240c5e86c34/3e1ded12?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=8229c72e984bbf6a"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8fa990e19d50220ee7ab91ea02828d10/40321f8a/Corol_0?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=61705dc3e170d658","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/85001eb7432fd051d406db6bbfa0c440/eb2e80eb/Corol_1?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f6166602887d980d","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1b82a280baf25de70ff6589140a3ff25/48c69491/Corol_2?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b594685fe7b15a08","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f5d65d6f1c3a3e1f7941225134ae402b/af4a1acd/Corol_3?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=f506bb7b819db1a5","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/50f538f8b537c0268f81855784994734/a7b2140a/Corol_4?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=9cc56596552a3ab8","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/955fa25f06619d0982feb252bc6809e5/51b1eb86/Corol_5?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=def4b69402b99086","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/21317eb4042cef930eb91771a6cbea5e/376af83d/Corol_6?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e89bbb14e8092716"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3f4caaa98c0aafea4cb8b1257c6b37e7/752963aa?ts=1652749770&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=9d8eb54811973a81","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"Ql-TNY1ZjzI","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recevB73MYDKoshPL_0.jpeg","recevB73MYDKoshPL_1.jpeg","recevB73MYDKoshPL_2.png","recevB73MYDKoshPL_3.jpeg","recevB73MYDKoshPL_4.jpeg","recevB73MYDKoshPL_5.png","recevB73MYDKoshPL_6.png"]},{"id":"recZm5WkMU8D6y9Vi","name":"twee twee","description":"Being a garden city, birds are present everywhere around us. At the moment, our little red dot holds around 414 different species of birds. There are many specific locations for bird watching in Singapore, but in reality, they are everywhere around us. We might not be able to spot them at first, but their calls ring loud and clear throughout the day. They are indeed a part of our lives, even if we don’t see them.\n\nWhen asked to draw birds, most people will draw a generic form which does not represent any specific species. The head, body, and wings, makes them easily identifiable as birds, even without too much detail. \n\ntwee twee is a series of roly poly that will play the sounds of the respective birds when destabilized. They are made of wood and include a sound module which is triggered by a motion sensor. Inspired by how many of us remember birds, twee twee represents all birds using one iconic form. Sounds and colours were then added on top of the form to transform them to specific species. \nOut of the wide range of birds in Singapore, we decided to zoom in on eleven species from different habitats. Certain birds such as the pigeons and mynahs can be seen from all around our urban areas while other birds like the collared kingfisher and the mangrove pitta prefer to stay at the coastal regions. Distinct colours from different parts of the bird are extracted from and transposed onto each surface of the form.\nThrough this project, we hope to draw more attention to the wide diversity of local birds present in Singapore. Twee twee exists as little pockets of joy, quaint and unassuming. Triggers nostalgia, and promotes curiosity.

Eulogy is a research-heavy service design project that aims to bring the appreciation of friendships and social circles into the customs of death. \n\nFrom interviews, insights and synthesis, I hypothesize that because family members are not in the correct mood to engage with guests at the funeral, I think that by designing a system of unspoken story telling, will allow family members space to grief yet at the same time gain information about the deceased’s friends that will help in the process of sorting through sentimental

Natural light cast on the spartan furnishings within give life and illumination to the suite. The composition of wooded elements seeks to achieve more than just a living space throughout the stay.\n \nCruising through the clouds, the mist membranes catch vapor which is then compressed and filtered into water for bathing and drinking. The water collected is pumped into the Onsen bath where passengers can freshen up during their journey. Excess water is vaporized and released back into the atmosphere.\n \nThe common area of the first floor, is furnished with wooden accents and soft ambient lighting familiar to the ambience of a home.

Examples of how this may be achieved are demonstrated in The Clean Bear, a book that teaches kids about good hygiene and self-care habits through pretend-play.

The embedded narratives in his works comment on design and its industry as a phenomenon, especially in the context of heritage, consumption and waste. His works have been shown in exhibitions such as “Singletown” at the Venice Biennale, “Surface art/design” in Dortmund and Cologne, “Beauty” at the Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial, Smithsonian Design Museum New York, and “Local Icons East/West” at MAXXI Museo, Rome.

His works are held in private collections, as well as public permanent collections at the National Collection of Singapore; M+ Museum for Visual Culture, Hong Kong; and the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, New York. Hans has also actively engaged in curatorial work and has produced several exhibitions with a keen interest in the discursive capacity of design to engage public perceptions. His penchant for design pedagogy is guided by the concept of deformative inquiry, developing imaginative thinking tools that provide novel approaches to the design process based on generative deformations, use of language and systematic reflection.
