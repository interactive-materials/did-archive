Sadly, we have become accustomed to appreciate the environment around us only when it is well-lit. Light pollution, especially in developed cities like Singapore, have altered the way we perceive the dark, and we subconsciously translate the mere loss of visibility to something frightening and macabre. As a result, we often overlook the beauty of nature at night, simply because we cannot, or perhaps, refuse to see it.\n\nYet nature still thrives at night, as shown by the blooming of the tropical moonflower (Ipomoea alba), whose petals open at dusk and fade at sunrise. This flowering vine produces multiple white sweet-smelling blooms every night, luring and supporting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. As the alter ego to the familiar diurnal morning glory, the moonflower becomes a testament to nature's unceasing beauty even in the darkest of nights.\n\nAkin to the pinhole camera, _Flora Obscura_ is a dark chamber of smoked glass and black ceramic, housing the nocturnal moonflower in the environment it flourishes in. Using the slight imbalance between the warmer inner temperature (due to the moonflower's respiration) and the cooler external air, a convection current is established, allowing air to be circulated in and out of the planter through the bottom air vents and the top opening. Picking up the moonflower's natural scent molecule Linalool (C10H18O) along the way, scientifically known for its soothing properties, this scented air is amplified and distributed throughout the room. As a bubble of the night in the house, Flora Obscura becomes a window to the less-explored domain of nature in the dark, and its scent a calming relief to the stressful fast-paced life in the city.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recEBgPuH7QUVlRGf","index":188},{"id":"rec2ODMhOsbvko4WR","index":229}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40bc858932c452212a72262a662e728/5e1e308b?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2d605bd53b38141b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a09388512b4cca6e5139749112895721/e47e8268?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=177c547f8c2c85cf","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/330aae1dddc840feefc35021224fedd6/e1ac82da?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=766a2d14f07585ce"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5f5dd155850ee2c72bdc55c44c79cd76/98bfa3b6/FloraObscura_0?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=de109c7390a6389c","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/57e760a1dfe8d0441d3f3831f3744584/97e9025b/FloraObscura_1?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=005ef5d1200bc006","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c9c8bf20231a0b7fed353d9525471727/6232edb1/FloraObscura_2?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=870994508c2c80a8"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f40bc858932c452212a72262a662e728/5e1e308b?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=2d605bd53b38141b","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"abO3FvOn6o4","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recAnxXl58sggAcjh_0.jpeg","recAnxXl58sggAcjh_1.jpeg","recAnxXl58sggAcjh_2.jpeg"]},{"id":"recW8E3GHY9HnQN11","gradsite":true,"name":"Dead or Alive","description":"The animals behind the meat we consume daily are hidden from us for a reason.

By calling attention to this overlooked segregation of alive and dead animals, we hope to elicit contemplation about our existing connection to livestock."],"video":{"id":"Y52JHA8lzIo","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recW8E3GHY9HnQN11_0.jpeg","recW8E3GHY9HnQN11_1.jpeg","recW8E3GHY9HnQN11_2.jpeg","recW8E3GHY9HnQN11_3.jpeg"]},{"id":"recneZLCKnK1ECWrr","name":"Tsikato","description":"Tsikato is a sculptural piece, sparking curiosity and conversation of the noise pollution we contribute that affects the Cicadas while amplifying their music and protecting them from our noise pollution.\n","platform":{"id":"recYmVupbY4cPWPIO","index":0},"designers":[{"id":"recoWBYxVS9I173BG","index":208},{"id":"rec3AdtNUDnvvimra","index":233}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c121e7cf07ced4dd444ccb79210a30bb/200415d8?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a4e5c75a554f1921","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4571fe7a87e24130d9796db176b14814/4c427b40?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=418f57a52427277e","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/db2c5fae18c69a24243f2997c778f616/3b647aab?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=d430882dc51a17a9","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/28277bfa7e93ec7daf06a05bee7b4389/9e94f814?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=534d847cd19a5d98","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6bfcde27d6bdaa97c6ac61a5245ebbf2/2555f0be?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=4563fd4b932f2b6d","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/51999e746996da66adca87fba44df525/190d3225?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=6eca4a1fd82a90d2"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/535001d898a5300eb6d2b32ccd0b05d4/a2c6a104/Tsikato_0?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=6ffeadcfcbfbaab5","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/32e8c28e2f9ded0a0381879b68444981/8018524e/Tsikato_1?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=7ec4e5b32d857856","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5fddfa4e6ad33e9069d8545da986107c/85c77afa/Tsikato_2?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=30f68879889ba3fc","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0fa842b0b161c28c824a45503c7d6ee7/4b0a1743/Tsikato_3?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b9b2ff8e83567a72","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/12eb530ce70d048ad703f720fd62fee9/886a78f8/Tsikato_4?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=39b8b106a7b7a2e3","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/da961db1a9c66424e49f9044b0c0ebc3/44aa1c2f/Tsikato_5?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=b93c621b44f2e1a1"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c121e7cf07ced4dd444ccb79210a30bb/200415d8?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=a4e5c75a554f1921","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"wJ4UQ-bxHFI","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Design Futures & Critical Inquiry","Product Innovation"],"tags":["Product Design","Discursive Design","Exploratory Design"],"imageNames":["recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_0.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_1.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_2.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_3.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_4.jpeg","recneZLCKnK1ECWrr_5.jpeg"]},{"id":"recL0tHeWEQT4ai8x","gradsite":true,"name":"Inkterface","description":"This project explores the possibility of transforming the smartphone user interface, which only exists in 2D, into a 3D format.

Since contact between these conductive and insulated surfaces produce static electricity, it may be harnessed to translate common physical interactions into digital feedback in interactive books. Examples of how this may be achieved are demonstrated in The Clean Bear, a book that teaches kids about good hygiene and self-care habits through pretend-play. Light and sound feedback are used as sensory cues to encourage proper habits such as brushing teeth, flossing and brushing hair, thereby improving their motor skills as well.\n","platform":{"id":"recOtcAlvZiyD3azc","index":18},"designers":[{"id":"recec9ich8mg4CzrK","index":195}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9339fe550f4e7fc15bc31ba9dc5fc6d7/73097a98?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=58c3b81aeb418417","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9bc48eb9a4a419eb82f51012298bfd36/9e146e27?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=ecb104ab8af11e63","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a7a11a934b84404ef08c119781665303/70014329?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=59598ef2a1802fb4"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ce17c53869353b5878a139cf9717f5fc/147d3052/TheCleanBear_0?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=12aa09605c131c26","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/19353c3b42182ad6789a397739ea55a7/515c2356/TheCleanBear_1?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=0b374afd8b9d0043","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/497e717258dddd091152fe0410d7b582/d44006e7/TheCleanBear_2?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=0b85d96981bcf1f6"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9339fe550f4e7fc15bc31ba9dc5fc6d7/73097a98?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=58c3b81aeb418417","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"640233973","type":"vimeo"},"specialization":["Product Innovation"],"imageNames":["recIl9qGPpMwudDP0_0.jpeg","recIl9qGPpMwudDP0_1.jpeg","recIl9qGPpMwudDP0_2.png"]},{"id":"recvuofSxd2fOiqVq","name":"Please clear your plate","description":"This project aims to remind users who utilize the trays and utensils in a food court setting to return their used utensils to inculcate courtesy and to help space clearing for more efficient and cleaner space at our common consumption areas.\n","platform":{"id":"recOtcAlvZiyD3azc","index":18},"designers":[{"id":"rec9cdCUS4QyKrRQB","index":255}],"collaborators":"","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c52bbeafe8230844d7885c35691202db/0f112646?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=73e790cd1dddae39"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/03bd756685b73b2b6fb7ba110ecccec0/3e5cde46/Pleaseclearyourplate_0?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=565d7165a2c1cb74"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c52bbeafe8230844d7885c35691202db/0f112646?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=73e790cd1dddae39","captions":[""],"video":{"id":"NlS5HeTI1O4","type":"youtube"},"specialization":["Product Innovation"],"imageNames":["recvuofSxd2fOiqVq_0.jpeg"]},{"id":"rec2VXYTPAeXPsoUZ","name":"Cattery","description":"Cattery harnesses triboelectric sensing effect to create easy-to-create switches that are safe and readily assembled to create a customisable lamp.

As long as there’s a tree, there can be Ringscape. The installation of rings in different sizes and inclinations creates diverse playscapes while remaining visually simple. By varying the orientation and elevation of rings, each element in Ringscape gives a child a different experience with the tree—some encourage them to touch the tree, while others guide them to observe the leaves, branches, and roots up close. Each element promotes a child’s development in the physical, social, or cognitive dimension. Over time, the trees grow and intertwine with the rings in symbiosis. Although a ring is simple, it opens endless possibilities.\n","platform":{"id":"recZwoLcOOjt0k5gd","index":75},"designers":[{"id":"recKD6kWAOUFxMgFB","index":15},{"id":"recM9EGPE735s96EJ","index":84}],"collaborators":"Aya Ayoubi, Claire Chou, in collaboration with NTUC First Campus","images":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/be5be2c9d5bd58cd0f3a9208a2a7eef8/afc5dc9c?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=00293755ebabf4a6","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/50f8796f0fc732ce342df7951e8adaae/d33602b9?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e3e9bb9e458f5fc6","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f64fa75163f844db43c69917981d677f/7c1a3d46?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=1c8394228df3a1e0","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0d623e836fd4c24e0175761821166271/3ffd5c64?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=e4068a21e84c53dc"],"imagesFull":["https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7e41e406838c4ac93bc068389764f671/d8da9c70/Ringscape-Hero.jpg?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=439ca315c320add6","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ca82a2172e78929abaf490c2271deaaf/8ecf9c1b/Social-Ring.jpg?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=1ce3d5b122f6df9b","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/85822eabd0cbfbadade262b72083e001/e9a7c79a/Ringscape-Slide.jpg?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=401a5c4c9e8fa1e4","https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/44234fcd9b6bb756693ae975abb20573/9653a2da/Bouncy-Ring.jpg?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=832f333e795a0b1d"],"thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/be5be2c9d5bd58cd0f3a9208a2a7eef8/afc5dc9c?ts=1654134197&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=00293755ebabf4a6","captions":["","The biggest ring marks a sacred zone around a tree.

He deploys design as medium, making use of utility as a pretext for visual discourse, while maintaining a keen focus in developing materials and processes. The embedded narratives in his works comment on design and its industry as a phenomenon, especially in the context of heritage, consumption and waste. His works have been shown in exhibitions such as “Singletown” at the Venice Biennale, “Surface art/design” in Dortmund and Cologne, “Beauty” at the Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial, Smithsonian Design Museum New York, and “Local Icons East/West” at MAXXI Museo, Rome. He is a two-time winner of Design of the Year at the President's Design Award, Singapore's highest design accolade. His works are held in private collections, as well as public permanent collections at the National Collection of Singapore; M+ Museum for Visual Culture, Hong Kong; and the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, New York. Hans has also actively engaged in curatorial work and has produced several exhibitions with a keen interest in the discursive capacity of design to engage public perceptions. His penchant for design pedagogy is guided by the concept of deformative inquiry, developing imaginative thinking tools that provide novel approaches to the design process based on generative deformations, use of language and systematic reflection. The student works developed under his supervision has garnered many international awards, and he is a three-time winner of the NUS Annual Excellent Teaching Award.\n","portrait":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/916d883fb19c0ab02f48f74db6c8a80f/bd41a0df/Hans_Tan_v3.jpg?ts=1654134199&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=7b7d941c249f440e","thumbnail":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e76fa978a60bb53a6abc5c8daa3c22a9/9e769754?ts=1654134199&userId=usru8TTNPIpGFcJZH&cs=1736d9b2ae05755f","email":"hans@nus.edu.sg","link":"https://hanstan.net/","platforms":[{"id":"recAV4nYxdYomj4T9","index":2},{"id":"recDDWRO1WcHneotE","index":37},{"id":"recRvYINQzpCzZNhe","index":50},{"id":"rec0OzteP5gigq7tP","index":77},{"id":"recoHhsXsL7i9RcnJ","index":100},{"id":"recm8lrYmJGKUvLTn","index":116},{"id":"rec8A4HoMecvFfu0v","index":117}],"thesis":[{"id":"recVV6GSnWTGWHlbQ","index":40},{"id":"recuY14V2hnKVxbT4","index":25},{"id":"reckXCpGUQg0jFDw3","index":30},{"id":"recUrEopAFnsGybuo","index":15},{"id":"rec778SZhj32lBLV8","index":13},{"id":"recalvDKLqSjFXN87","index":14}],"active":"Actively teaching","position":"Full Time","order":2,"imageNames":["recuASntmmDCKQFId_0.jpeg"]},{"id":"recDyMJ3kM1DtHkTF","name":"Lee Jung-Joo","bio":"JJ has expertise in Service Design, Human-Centered Design, Co-Design and User Experience Design.

However you could also drive, hike, or take a cable car up the mountain, which are experiences in themselves. This project investigates how controls affect our relationship with game worlds thus our experiences with them, through the space of alternative control games. Even for a single interaction, like jumping, the way we input that jump in physical reality can drastically change the meanings it can have. This space is an opportunity to design new game experiences around controllers.\n\n«Press What? to Jump» is the expression of this exploration, a game about swapping between different alternative controllers for the same action.

Before children reach 9 years old, learning units using metres and centimetres is too abstract for them.
